About Us
Why We Exist
Political outcomes are too often shaped by theater, not strategy — and by money without alignment.
While business leaders have long influenced policy from the sidelines, we’ve lacked a civic structure to move capital, relationships, and ideas with intentionality.
The Kick exists to change that. We’re building lasting infrastructure for aligned political engagement, built on capital, clarity, and long-view outcomes.
What We Believe
What We Believe
• That civic investment is serious work,  and it deserves systems that match that seriousness.
• That Democratic outcomes require more than values,  they require infrastructure.
• You don’t have to wear a label to do the work. But you do have to show up for it.
• That we don’t need to agree on everything, we just need to move in the same direction.
• That influence is not a dirty word when it’s used to build.
Our Origin
The Kick was created by a group of civic and business leaders who saw a clear gap. There was no consistent way for serious contributors to influence local Democratic outcomes with focus, strategy, and accountability. Campaigns came and went. Meetings happened. Money moved — but nothing durable was taking shape. So they built something new: a platform to organize capital, coordinate engagement, and build the political infrastructure they knew would be needed for the long term.
What We’re Building
Most political engagement is reactive, fragmented, and driven by short-term urgency. The Kick was created to build something more deliberate — a durable platform for business leaders to engage in politics with strategy, consistency, and aligned influence.
We’re building real infrastructure:
A coordinated endorsement process that reflects shared priorities
A strategic approach to candidate support and resource deployment
Policy development informed by business expertise and long-term thinking
A Space for Houston’s business leaders to connect
Absolutely — here’s a clean, strategic outline for the Engagement Page, built for clarity, positioning, and practical navigation.
This page should:
Showcase how members engage regularly and meaningfully
Anchor your monthly luncheon series as the heartbeat of real connection
Quietly but clearly signal openness to disaffected conservatives without compromising The Kick’s Democratic posture
Point toward participation, not passive observation


🗂️ Engagement Page Outline
1. Page Intro: What We Mean by Engagement
How Supporters Stay Plugged In
The Kick Enterprise Club is a structured platform for ongoing engagement,  built for business leaders who want to connect with peers, contribute strategically, and stay involved between election cycles.
Engagement here means more than attending events. It means showing up to shape policy conversations, support aligned candidates, and help build the infrastructure that moves Democratic outcomes forward in a lasting way.
2. Signature Series: Monthly Leadership Lunches
Held monthly, this is The Kick’s central forum for trusted engagement. These gatherings are designed for members to hear directly from elected officials, candidates, policy leaders, and issue experts — without the noise of public forums or the fluff of staged panels.
Each session is grounded in real-time context: what’s moving, what matters, and where aligned capital and strategy can have impact. But the most valuable outcome is the one we’ve designed intentionally: trusted relationships among business leaders who are serious about outcomes, not optics.
3. A Space for Principled Alignment
Not everyone feels at home in today’s political landscape,  and that’s exactly why this space exists. The Kick was built for people who think long-term, act with intention, and believe in contributing to outcomes that reflect shared priorities.
We don’t define people by where they’ve been, we organize around strategic alignment: with leaders who understand that lasting change requires more than belief. It requires structure, capital, and people willing to build beyond old affiliations.
4. Ready to Engage?
The Kick Enterprise Club is for people who are ready to invest time, capital, or expertise into something more lasting.
Whether you’re exploring membership, want to attend a Monthly Leadership Luncheon, or are simply looking to connect with aligned leaders — let’s start the conversation.

✅  Endorsements Page Outline
Endorsements at The Kick Enterprise Club
The Kick exists to connect serious resources to serious outcomes — and that includes backing candidates who reflect shared priorities and governing competence.
Our endorsement process is designed to be rigorous, selective, and grounded in long-term thinking. We’re building a structure that reflects the values and expectations of our membership: clarity, accountability, and impact.
We will announce our first cohort of endorsed candidates ahead of the 2026 general election.
More information will be shared as the process is finalized — including how members can participate in candidate evaluation and platform alignment.

Member Directory
We’re building a private-access directory to help members connect more intentionally. It’s a functional tool for identifying fellow contributors across industries, sectors, and areas of interest. Whether you’re looking to build partnerships, share knowledge, or tap into expertise, the directory makes it easier to find people invested in each other’s outcomes.
The Dealroom (RFP Platform)
The Dealroom is a private space where members can post and respond to real opportunities — from vendor contracts to research collaborations and service requests. It’s built to make sure that the people doing the work also have access to the work. If you’re part of the Kick, you should be able to do business with people you trust.
